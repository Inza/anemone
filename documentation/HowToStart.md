# How to start using the Anemone platform

You can use the Anemone platform either as a **User** or as a **Developer**.

In order to start *as a User*, all you need to do is:

1. [Sign up](http://www.anemone.cloud/users/sign_up) for free on the Anemone platform website. Select your account avatar while doing so (by a name of the icon only - that is the real fun!)
2. Download the **Mobile Client app for iOS or Android** (you can find links to apps on our website [http://www.anemone.cloud](http://www.anemone.cloud))
3. Find some **Tentacle** which you would like to control. In order to control a Tentacle, you need to either *own it* (which means to [build it](https://github.com/ceskasporitelna/anemone/blob/master/documentation/HowToBuildAnemoneTentacle.md) first), or be invited to it *as a guest*
4. Take a full control of the Tentacle. You can **control the running app** as both guest and owner. Or **switch the running app** for another one or **trigger Tentacle share mode** as owner.  Both can be done from the Mobile Client or Cloud administration

When starting *as a Developer* do the following:

1. [Sign up](http://www.anemone.cloud/users/sign_up) for free on the Anemone platform website. Select your account avatar while doing so *(by a name of the icon only - that is only way which contains the real fun!)*
2. Download the **Mobile Client app for iOS or Android** (you can find links to apps on our website [http://www.anemone.cloud](http://www.anemone.cloud))
3. [Build](https://github.com/ceskasporitelna/anemone/blob/master/documentation/HowToBuildAnemoneTentacle.md) a **Tentacle**. Every real developer has its own Tentacle 
4. [Make an Anemone app](https://github.com/ceskasporitelna/anemone/blob/master/documentation/HowToMakeAnemoneApp.md). Prepare the *interface.json*, *manifest.json* and *arduino sketch* .hex files for your application. Login to the cloud administration **and add your first Anemone app**
5. **Install the app on your Tentacle** via *OTA* from cloud administration (by pressing a Install button)
5. **Test the app** on your Tentacle when being in a *sandbox* mode.
6. **Submit the app for approval** to the public apps repository via button in the cloud administration
7. The anemone team will review and **approve the app**
8. Every user of the platform can **download the app and use it**
9. Congratulations - you are now Anemone apps developer. **The world is yours**!
