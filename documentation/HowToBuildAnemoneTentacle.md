# How to build Anemone Tentacle

Anemone Tentacle is a DYI Open Hardware device you can build and 3D print a cute case for it.

> Tentacle is fully Open Hardware device based on Arduino YÚN and Arduino TFT Display. It can be used as part of [Anemone Platform](http://www.anemone.cloud) or completelly standalone as a nice case for Arduino YÚN and Arduino TFT display.

## How Tentacle looks like?

TODO 2 images

Tentacle has three hardware controls which you can see on the following image:

TODO image

* The **top button** is used as a *back button* by the [Anemone arduino library](https://github.com/ceskasporitelna/anemone/tree/master/toolkit/anemone-arduino-library), but can be used in your Anemone apps as well
* The **side knob** is used as a *menu button & controller* and should not be used for any other purpose than a menu trigger and navigation
* The **front button** is used as a *cloud button* by the Anemone arduino library and it should not be used in your Anemone app at all *(the user should always have the ability to switch Tentacle to the share mode - without caring about where in your Anemone app he is currently present)*

> Of course these limitations/recomendations only applye when you use the Tentacle inside the [Anemone Platform](http://www.anemone.cloud) with the [Anemone arduino library](https://github.com/ceskasporitelna/anemone/tree/master/toolkit/anemone-arduino-library). When using the Tentacle outside of the Anemone ecosystem, feel free to repurpose all the buttons as you see fit.

## That is nice! How to build it?

In this tutorial we will guide you throught the Tentacle building process.

In order to build your very own Tentacle you need to do the following:

1. Buy *(or somehow gather)* all the needed parts. See the [parts list](#parts-list).
2. Build the Tentacle core *(= put together the Tentacle electronic circuits)*
3. Build the Tentacle outer shell *(= 3D print the Tentacle case)*
4. Integrate Tentacle to into the shell *(= insert the electronic circuits into the 3D printed case)*
5. Install the Tentacle software
6. Connect your Tentacle to the [Anemone Cloud](http://www.anemone.cloud).

And that's it! ;)

## Step 1 - Gather the Anemone Tentacle parts

In order to build a Tentacle you will need the following:

In order to make your life easier we have prepared a list of links where you can buy all the Tentacle parts:

> This is just a hint ;). All the parts are **Open Hardware** you can buy them in your favourite shop, local hardware store, etc.
